INTRODUCTION					*vimcrypt2-introduction*

The *vimcrypt2* ( *vimcrypt2.vim* ) will encrypt/decrypt files when read/written by vim.
You will have to enter the password that the encryption key is derived from once, per editor session.
This is different from other solutions, where you have to enter the password each time that the buffer is saved.

The plugin encrypts files of the following extensions: *.aes,*.cast,*.rc5,*.desx

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS

You need to have openssl installed on the system, and in the current path.
Also you need to have the python3 option enabled in vim.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND     					*vimcrypt2-command*

Read and write a file with any one of the following extensions: *.aes,*.cast,*.rc5,*.desx
The first read/write in the editor session will prompt for the password, following read/writes in the same editor session
will use the same password.

More details on the actions of this editor:

- After decrypting a file, we take the password and save it in memory. Now the key is not kept in plain text form, 
it is encrypted with a master key, the master key is a random key that is generated per editor session.

- The very same key that has been used for decryption is then used for encryption, when the file is saved back to disk.

- The key is passed to openssl via a pipe, and not via a command line option. It would be visible to anyone, as a command line option.
The password is less exposed, as it is passed via a pipe. Now this can't be done with vimscript, that's were we need to use python3;
 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

This plugin is based on openssl.vim by Noah Spurrier https://github.com/vim-scripts/openssl.vim
